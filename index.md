## Small businesses can save the Internet

<div class="section intro-copy">

The first week of May is national “Small Business Week.” Thousands of small businesses are signing on to this open letter to Congress, just weeks before they’re expected to vote on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to block the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.

Small businesses will be hurt the most by the loss of net neutrality, but can also play a key role in saving it. Members of Congress take businesses owners from their district very seriously. We're delivering the letter on May 2, so we have until then to get as many businesses to sign as possible. Please spread the word!

Dear Congress, 

We are companies who rely on the open Internet to grow our business and reach
customers online. We are asking Congress to issue a “Resolution of Disapproval”
to restore net neutrality and the other consumer protections that were lost
when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal the 2015 Open
Internet Order in December 2017.

Users and businesses need certainty that they will not be blocked, throttled or
charged extra fees by Internet service providers. We cannot afford to be left
unprotected while Congress deliberates.

We will accept nothing less than the protections embodied in the 2015 order.
Please ensure the FCC keeps its tools to protect consumers and business like
ours.

Thank you for considering our views.
