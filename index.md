# Open letter:

## Businesses for overturning the FCC's Net Neutrality repeal

</div>

<div class="section intro-copy">

Since the FCC’s December vote to kill net neutrality, companies and
users across the country have been pressuring Congress to pass a
Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution that would overturn the
agency’s repeal.

If passed, the CRA would restore protections that stop ISPs from
blocking and throttling your sites and apps, or charging companies new
fees to reach customers online.

To get this CRA passed, we’re organizing an open letter from businesses
who want to see strong net neutrality rules in place. Enter your info
below to add your company’s name and ask Congress to overturn the FCC’s
net neutrality repeal.

<strong><a href="//businesses_for_net_neutrality.pdf">Download the PDF</a></strong>

We are companies who rely on the open Internet to grow our business and reach
customers online. We are asking Congress to issue a “Resolution of Disapproval”
to restore net neutrality and the other consumer protections that were lost
when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal the 2015 Open
Internet Order in December 2017.

Users and businesses need certainty that they will not be blocked, throttled or
charged extra fees by Internet service providers. We cannot afford to be left
unprotected while Congress deliberates.

We will accept nothing less than the protections embodied in the 2015 order.
Please ensure the FCC keeps its tools to protect consumers and business like
ours.

Thank you for considering our views.

Sincerely,

</div>
